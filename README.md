I am building upon the 2022 project. In the 2022 project we discovered key success correlation indicators in a team's ranking performance. These predictive models were successful in the opening rounds, but they were too broad to predict the most significant outcome, picking the eventual winner. It was discovered that successfully predicting the eventual winner is far more important than the ability to pick a wide variety of the early round games. 

In this project I am narrowing the scope of the project in order to predict the winning team. While the previous analysis will be used throughout the first two rounds, a new methodology to predict the winner will be used to identify teams that are likely to have Final Four success. 

## The images below showcase the previous analyses:
